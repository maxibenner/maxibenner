## Hey, I'm Maximilian

I build distributed, scalable, high performance systems. My background is in journalism and media so I am most excited when I can pair my software engineering expertise with the domains I am passionate about: environment, energy, industry, and community service.

None of my work exemplifies this better than [Give a Meal](https://www.give-a-meal.org); A food sharing network utilizing existing restaurant infrastructure to provide meals to people in need. It is constantly growing and we are currently in the process of designing hardware terminals to simplify the redemption of free meals.

I enjoy learning, learning, learning, collaboration, and perfecting the systems I engage with, both technical and non-technical. You can take a look at my non-code work on [my new site](https://www.maximilianbenner.com).
